First todo-list react app I'm trying to create.

Trying before watching actual Ben's giude on that thing.

Taking on I barely know html/css - good luck to me :)


Expected functionality:

+1. add todo

+2. display todos

+3. cross off todo (left mouse click on it)

+4. show number of active/done todos

*5. 2 separate boxes active|complete, maybe later merge

+6. delete todo (right mouse click)

+7. delete all complete (btn)

+7.1 only show if at least one todo is complete

+8. button to toggle all on/off (?) 
(probably for me to remember display: none thing, but I get it, so won't do, complete!)


At this point main goal is done, todo list is working as a concept, but I should learn how to and perform following ones:


9. Make it look beautiful and act better(?)

10. SQL db to store and load todos + what've been done just now / done through all the time

11. Per-user split in db by entering id/pass on todo-app load (?)

*Personally expect:


1. A lot of external html/css :)
