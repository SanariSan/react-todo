First todo-list react app I'm trying to create.

Trying before watching actual Ben's giude on that thing.

Taking on I barely know html/css - good luck to me :)

Expected functionality:

1. add todo
2. display todos
3. cross off todo (left mouse click on it)
4. show number of active/done todos
*5. 2 separate boxes active|complete, maybe later merge
6. delete todo (right mouse click)
7. delete all complete (btn)
    / 7.1 only show if at least one todo is complete
8. button to toggle all on/off (?)

*Personally expect:

A lot of external html/css
