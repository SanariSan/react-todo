First todo-list react app I'm trying to create.
Trying before watching actual Ben's giude on that thing.
Taking on I barely know html/css - good luck to me :)

Expected functionality:

1. add todo
2. dosplay todos
3. cross off todo
4. show number of active todos
5. filter all/active/complete
6. delete todo
7. delete all complete
    7.1 only show if at least one todo is complete
8. button to toggle all on/off (?)

*Personally expect:

A lot of external html/css
