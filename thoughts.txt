So, what will my todo look like

visual side:

Last thing to care about


code side:

main component(cp) - App.js
here I connect following cps:

-cp Head {
    -cp Title

    -cp Stats (active todos, completed todos)
}
-cp Body {
    -cp TodoList (with all I have to do)

    -cp DoneList (where complete goes, 
        so you can put them back or delete completely)

    -cp Settings (maybe) (Here you set color of the task that will be added / that you editing(??))
}

And yes, I should somehow store all the created todos.
Probably with sql db. Need to find how do you actually access db from .sql file.

Think for now without per-user separation, maybe add later
